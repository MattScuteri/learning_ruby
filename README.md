# learning_ruby

An attempt at a hangman game calling a simple API using Ruby.

When completed, the app will select a random James Bond movie from the txt file, convert it to underscores and allow the user to guess letters up to a certain point.

If the player gets stuck, they can type "hint" to receive the plot of the James Bond movie from OMDB to help spur their thinking.
